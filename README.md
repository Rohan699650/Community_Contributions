🌍 Community Contributions

This repository highlights my real-world contributions toward creating a safer, more aware, and more compassionate community.
Beyond academics and technology, I believe in responsible citizenship and supporting people, animals, and the environment around me.

🔐 Cyber Safety Awareness

I conducted cyber safety awareness sessions for local community members, helping them:

Secure their smartphones and computers

Identify scam calls, phishing attempts, and fraudulent messages

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)

Understand basic digital hygiene and password safety

These sessions aimed to make technology safer and more accessible for everyone, especially non-technical individuals.

🐾 Animal Welfare Support

I provided first-aid assistance to an injured stray dog and ensured it received safe care.
This experience strengthened my sense of empathy, responsibility, and willingness to take action when needed.

🌟 Why I Do This

I believe real impact comes from small, consistent actions — educating people, helping animals, and contributing to a safer community.
These efforts reflect my commitment to:

Social responsibility

Empathy and moral leadership

Empowering others through knowledge

📌 Future Plans

I plan to continue contributing through:

More cyber-safety awareness workshops

Animal rescue and first-aid volunteering

Neighborhood environmental activities

Community education programs
